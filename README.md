# Landing Page for WildWatch LLC

## Two product offerings for A/B Testing

To explore customer interest in the proposed WildWatch products, we're developing a landing page to collect email addresses. In order to ascertain some basic information, we're testing and structuring the deployment of these pages for marketing purposes.

One page will be designed for the WildWatch wilderness solutions technology, which includes the remote field sensors and dashboard application.

The other page will be designed to advertise and build awareness of the RescueBand technology, including emergency alerts, interpretive app, and automated drone-response mechanisms.
